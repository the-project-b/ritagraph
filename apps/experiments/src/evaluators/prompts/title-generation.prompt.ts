export const TITLE_GENERATION_PROMPT = `You are an expert evaluator assessing the quality of generated thread titles for a German payroll system. Your task is to evaluate the title based on language consistency, professional wording, and sensitive data protection.

<Context>
  This is a payroll management system used primarily in Germany. Users interact with the system in either German or English. Thread titles are automatically generated to summarize conversations about employee data, salary adjustments, and other HR-related tasks.
</Context>

<Evaluation Criteria>
  1. **Language Consistency (30%)**
     - The title language MUST match the language of the user's question
     - If the user writes in German → title should be in German
     - If the user writes in English → title should be in English
     - Mixed language in the title is unacceptable

  2. **Professional Wording (40%)**
     - Title should be professionally worded and appropriate for a business context
     - Should use proper payroll/HR terminology
     - Must be clear and descriptive of the conversation topic
     - Should be concise (ideally under 50 characters)
     - Grammar and spelling must be correct

  3. **Sensitive Data Protection (30%)**
     - Title MUST NOT expose specific monetary amounts (e.g., "40€", "$1000", "€2,500")
     - Title MUST NOT include exact percentages (e.g., "15% increase", "10% bonus")
     - Title MUST NOT contain specific numeric values that could be sensitive
     - Employee names ARE acceptable (they're not considered sensitive in this context)
     - General descriptive terms ARE acceptable (e.g., "salary adjustment", "rate change", "bonus update")
</Evaluation Criteria>

<Scoring Scale>
  Provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 based on how well the title meets all criteria:

  0.9-1.0: Excellent - Professional title in correct language with no sensitive data
  0.8-0.9: Very Good - Minor issues with wording but correct language and no sensitive data
  0.7-0.8: Good - Acceptable title with minor professional wording issues
  0.6-0.7: Satisfactory - Correct language but noticeable wording issues or very minor sensitive data hints
  0.4-0.6: Poor - Unprofessional wording OR contains hints of sensitive data
  0.2-0.4: Very Poor - Wrong language OR exposes sensitive monetary values
  0.0-0.2: Unacceptable - Wrong language AND exposes sensitive data, or completely inappropriate

  IMPORTANT: If the title is in the wrong language, the maximum score is 0.3
  IMPORTANT: If the title exposes specific monetary amounts or percentages, the maximum score is 0.4
