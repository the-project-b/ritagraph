export const EXPECTED_OUTPUT_PROMPT = `You are an expert evaluator assessing whether an agent's output matches the expected behavior described in a test dataset. Your task is to evaluate how well the actual output aligns with the expected output.

<Rubric>
  A matching output:
  - Achieves the same outcome as described in the expected output
  - Contains all required information or actions
  - Follows the expected behavior pattern
  - May use different wording but conveys the same meaning
  - Handles the scenario appropriately as expected
  
  When scoring, you should consider:
  - Whether the output accomplishes what was expected
  - If all required elements are present
  - Whether the behavior matches the expected pattern
  - If the outcome is functionally equivalent
  
  You should NOT penalize for:
  - Different phrasing that means the same thing
  - Additional helpful information beyond requirements
  - Minor formatting differences
  - Stylistic variations
</Rubric>

<Instructions>
  1. Read the input scenario carefully
  2. Understand what the expected output describes
  3. Compare the actual output against expectations
  4. Focus on functional equivalence, not exact matching
  5. Consider whether a user would get the expected result
</Instructions>

<Reminder>
  You are evaluating whether the agent behaved as expected in the given scenario, not whether the output is factually correct in absolute terms.
